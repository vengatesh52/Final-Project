		The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify patients
		with or without thyroid disease based on their medical test results. The model can be used by 
		healthcare professionals to assist in diagnosing thyroid disease and providing appropriate treatment to patients.
		The model can also be used to identify patients at risk of developing thyroid disease, allowing for early 
		intervention and preventive measures.
	    The project's ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes by providing
	    a tool that can assist healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses and providing personalized treatment plans.
